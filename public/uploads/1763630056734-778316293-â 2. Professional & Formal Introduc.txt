✅ 2. Professional & Formal Introduction

Good morning. Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
My name is Vishal Kumar, and I belong to Begusarai. I completed my schooling from SMS and am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology from NIET.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained strong interest and hands-on experience in frontend and Java backend development. I have developed several projects, including a Netflix clone, a real-time chat application built with React and Firebase, and a weather forecasting application.

I am proficient in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and MySQL.
Outside academics, I enjoy playing chess and cricket.

My key strength is my consistency and structured problem-solving approach. I focus on understanding problems deeply and finding logical solutions.
One area I have been improving is public speaking; regular participation in presentations and mock interviews has helped me gain confidence.
